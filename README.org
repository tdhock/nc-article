Title: Regular expressions and reshaping using data tables and the
  [[https://github.com/tdhock/nc][nc]] package

Abstract: Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables
  from non-tabular text data. Capturing regular expressions that
  describe information to extract from column names can be especially
  useful when reshaping a data table from wide (one row with many
  columns) to tall (one column with many rows). We present the R
  package nc (short for named capture), which provides functions for
  data reshaping, regular expressions, and a uniform interface to
  three C libraries (PCRE, RE2, ICU). We describe the main features of
  nc, then provide detailed comparisons with related R packages
  (stats, utils, data.table, tidyr, reshape2, cdata).

[[file:figure-iris-cols.R]] makes a figure showing that wide-to-tall data
reshaping using either data.table or nc packages is much faster than
other packages (cdata, stats, tidyr). This experiment uses inputs with
a fixed number of rows, and a variable number of input reshape
columns. Each function in the experiment outputs a table with multiple
(2) reshape columns. It shows that the quadratic time complexity of
cdata, stats, tidyr results in significant slowdowns when there are at
least 10,000 input reshape columns.
