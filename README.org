Title: Wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions and the
  [[https://github.com/tdhock/nc][nc]] package.

Abstract: Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables
  from non-tabular text data. Capturing regular expressions that
  describe information to extract from column names can be especially
  useful when reshaping a data table from wide (few rows with many
  regularly named columns) to tall (fewer columns with more rows). We
  present the R package nc (short for named capture), which
  provides functions for wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular
  expressions. We describe the main new ideas of nc, and
  provide detailed comparisons with related R packages (stats,
  utils, data.table, tidyr, tidyfast,
  tidyfst, reshape2, cdata).

** TODOs

compare with tidyfst::longer_dt? should be same as data.table::melt.

[[file:figure-iris-cols-new.R]] makes a new figure based on [[file:figure-iris-cols-new-data.R][timings]]
computed using updated R packages.

[[file:figure-iris-cols.R]] makes a figure, 
based on data computed by [[file:figure-iris-cols-data.R]],
which shows that wide-to-tall data
reshaping using either data.table or nc packages is much faster than
other packages (cdata, stats, tidyr). This experiment uses inputs with
a fixed number of rows, and a variable number of input reshape
columns. Each function in the experiment outputs a table with multiple
(2) reshape columns. It shows that the quadratic time complexity of
cdata, stats, tidyr results in significant slowdowns when there are at
least 10,000 input reshape columns.

[[file:figure-iris-cols.png]]

In contrast everything below appears to be linear in the number of input
columns when the output has only a single reshape column:

Note that stats::reshape is missing in the second plot here, but the result for a smaller N.col size can be seen here https://github.com/tdhock/nc-article/blob/master/figure-who-cols.png
