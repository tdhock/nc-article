Title: Regular expressions and reshaping using data tables and the
  [[https://github.com/tdhock/nc][nc]] package

Abstract: Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables
  from non-tabular text data. Capturing regular expressions that
  describe information to extract from column names can be especially
  useful when reshaping a data table from wide (one row with many
  columns) to tall (one column with many rows). We present the R
  package nc, which provides functions for data reshaping, regular
  expressions, and a uniform interface to three C libraries (PCRE,
  RE2, ICU). We describe the main features of nc, then provide
  detailed comparisons with related R packages (stats, utils,
  data.table, tidyr, reshape2, cdata).
